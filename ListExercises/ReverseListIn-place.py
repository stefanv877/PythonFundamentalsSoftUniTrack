6. Reverse List In-place
Read a list of integers on the first line of the console. After that, reverse the list in-place (as in, donâ€™t create a new
collection to hold the result, reverse it using only the original list). After you are done, print the reversed list on the
console.
Note: You are not allowed to iterate over the list backwards and just print it
